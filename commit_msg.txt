feat: MVP cleanup - Remove admin/support roles, add role deactivation

Roles System Cleanup (MVP):
- Removed admin and support roles from the system
- Now only 4 roles: student, mentor, reviewer, manager
- All existing admin/support users migrated to student role
- Removed Admin and Support profile models completely
- Deleted entire support app

Role Change Behavior:
- Implemented automatic profile deactivation on role change
- Old profile is set to is_active=False when user role changes
- New profile is created and activated automatically
- Prevents multiple active profiles per user

- 0004_remove_support_role.py - Delete Support model
- 0005_transfer_users_to_student.py - Migrate admin/support users to student

Managers Dashboard:

- System logs viewer
- Green theme, mobile responsive

Certificates System:
- Certificate generation on course completion
- Certificate verification system
- Email notifications

Static Files & Documentation:
